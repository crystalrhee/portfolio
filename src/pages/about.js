      <h1>I'm Crystal Rhee</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer from Boston, MA, specializing in
        frontend development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about the the ability to create and improve and hope to
        apply what I learned in classrooms to real world problems. Through my
        experience at previous co-ops and through my involvement in various
        projects and roles at Northeastern University, I have developed key
        organizational skills when working with interdisciplinary teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am constantly working on new projects and exploring new technologies
        and skills. I am confident that I have the right combination of skills
        and motivation to quickly acquire the necessary knowledge to thrive in
        any setting.
